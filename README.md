# IRCTC Automated Booking
A script to help you book IRCTC tickets faster. Right now it also helps you to login to your SBI account.

WARNING: Right now this script books the first listing when you search for the trains between statins.

## Thanks
I started with the gist from [avamsi](https://gist.github.com/avamsi/6172da9a46f3c9b8c163) and further modified and improved.

## Known Issues
* This script might book only the first train in the listing.
* You will have to manually enter all the captchas.
* Script waits for page load to be complete to fill forms.
